# CLAUDE.md — kuliah/admin

Architecture reference for Claude Code when working in `kuliah/`.

## What this is

`kuliah/admin/` is a full CMS admin dashboard for MAMTJ6 mosque lecture schedule management. Committee members log in with Google OAuth and manage:
- Monthly lecture schedules (subuh + maghrib sessions per day)
- Ustaz (penceramah) list with poster images
- Admin user accounts (super_admin only)
- Quick access to the live published schedule ("Lihat Terbitan" dropdown: view/export PDF, current + next month only)
- Bulk month actions ("Tindakan Bulan" dropdown: duplicate the previous month's ustaz assignments forward, or clear a month's data entirely)

`kuliah/jadual/` is the public-facing read-only schedule view that reads from the same published JSON.

## Tech Stack

- Pure HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JS (ES6+) — no npm, no build tools
- Supabase — PostgreSQL, Auth (Google OAuth), Storage (kuliah-assets bucket)
- Vercel — static hosting + `api/publish.js` serverless function
- GitHub — published data store (JSON pushed via API from publish endpoint)

## Supabase Schema

```sql
-- admins: who can log in
id uuid PK, email text UNIQUE, name text,
role text CHECK ('editor'|'super_admin'),
permissions jsonb,  -- { kuliah: bool }
created_at timestamptz

-- ustaz: penceramah registry
id uuid PK, full_name text NOT NULL, short_name text NOT NULL,
tajuk_kuliah text, poster_url text,
created_at timestamptz, updated_at timestamptz

-- schedule: one row per date
id uuid PK, date date UNIQUE NOT NULL,
subuh_ustaz_id uuid FK→ustaz(id),
maghrib_ustaz_id uuid FK→ustaz(id),
cuti_umum text, updated_at timestamptz

-- activity_log: accountability changelog (see Key Patterns below)
id uuid PK, created_at timestamptz,
actor_email text NOT NULL, actor_name text,
action text NOT NULL,       -- schedule_day_edit | schedule_duplicate | schedule_clear |
                             -- ustaz_create | ustaz_update | ustaz_delete |
                             -- admin_create | admin_update | admin_delete | publish
target_label text, detail text  -- both plain-text snapshots, never FKs
```

RLS is ON on all tables. Anon key used in browser (read/write with RLS). Service role key server-side only (Vercel env var).

## Data Flow

```
Admin edits day in dashboard.html
  → upsert to Supabase `schedule` (date is the conflict key)
  → click Terbitkan (publish)
  → POST /api/publish?month=YYYY-MM  (Bearer: session token)
  → api/publish.js validates token, reads schedule+ustaz from Supabase (service role)
  → builds jadual_lengkap_beta.json
  → pushes to GitHub via API (GITHUB_TOKEN env var)
  → GitHub Pages / Vercel serves updated JSON
```

## Key Patterns

**Nav HTML — always use this structure on all pages:**
```html
<nav id="main-nav">
  <span class="brand">Admin Kuliah</span>
  <button class="nav-toggle" onclick="toggleNav()" aria-label="Menu">&#9776;</button>
  <div class="nav-links">
    <a href="dashboard.html">Jadual</a>
    <a href="ustaz.html">Penceramah</a>
    <span class="spacer"></span>
    <button class="logout-btn" onclick="signOut()">Log Keluar</button>
  </div>
</nav>
```
`_injectSuperAdminNav()` in app.js inserts both "Pengguna" and "Log Aktiviti" links before `.spacer` inside `.nav-links`, each independently guarded against double-injection — so `users.html`/`userlog.html` can hardcode their own link (matching every other page's convention of hardcoding its own active link) while `dashboard.html`/`ustaz.html` gain both purely via injection. If you restructure nav or add a third super_admin-only page, update that function's array.

**Mobile breakpoints:**
- `≤768px` — tablet compact
- `≤640px` — phone: hamburger nav, card-per-row tables, day list calendar

**Data table mobile pattern:** Every JS-rendered `<td>` needs `data-label="..."` for the card-per-row mobile layout. CSS reads `content: attr(data-label)` via `::before`.

**Ustaz sort:** Always client-side with `localeCompare({ numeric: true })`. Never `.order('short_name')` on Supabase — it sorts lexicographically. Both `ustaz.js` (Penceramah page `#` column) and `dashboard.js` (day-editor Subuh/Maghrib dropdowns) sort this exact way so their numbering lines up — `dashboard.js`'s `openModal()` renders each option as `"{short_name} (N)"` (suffix, not prefix, so the browser's native type-to-jump-by-letter still works), 0-indexed, with `"— Tiada Kuliah —"` pinned first and unnumbered. These numbers are a recalculated position, not a stored field — they shift if the ustaz roster changes.

**`isYasinEntry(ustaz)` (app.js):** matches `/yasi+n/i` against `short_name + full_name` combined, to detect the "Bacaan Yasiin & Tahlil" special ustaz entry regardless of which field has which spelling ("Yasin" vs "Yasiin"). `dashboard.js` uses it to swap the calendar's session-tag pill / mobile day-list text to a `.yasin`/`.mdc-yasin` light-green style instead of the normal subuh/maghrib colors. Use this helper (not a hardcoded dropdown position — those aren't stable) if this needs extending anywhere else.

**Poster save (3-way logic in saveUstaz):**
- `pendingRemovePoster` → `poster_url: null`
- New file or URL entered → `poster_url: newValue`
- Neither → omit `poster_url` from payload (preserves existing)

**Cache-busting:** `vercel.json` serves `Cache-Control: no-store` for `/kuliah/admin/(.*)` and `/kuliah/jadual/(.*)`. `no-store` (not `max-age=0, must-revalidate`) is required — `must-revalidate` still lets mobile Chrome serve the page from bfcache with zero network request, so a stale copy with old JS can resurface after backgrounding the app. `no-store` disables bfcache for these routes.

**Dropdown menu pattern:** `.month-actions` (wrapper, `position: relative`) + `.month-actions-menu` (absolute-positioned panel, `.open` class toggles `display`) + `.month-actions-item` (row). Closed via a single shared `document.addEventListener('click', ...)` in `dashboard.js`; each trigger button calls `e.stopPropagation()` so its own click doesn't immediately close it again. Both the "Tindakan Bulan" (Salin Data / Kosongkan) and "Lihat Terbitan" (Tunjukkan Jadual / Export PDF) dropdowns in `dashboard.html` reuse this exact CSS — reuse it for any future dropdown rather than inventing a new one.

**Publish merges by absolute month key, prunes stale months:** `jadual_lengkap_beta.json` is `{ "months": { "YYYY-MM": { infoJadual, senaraiHari }, ... } }`. Each `Terbitkan` click (`api/publish.js`) reads the existing file, writes only `months[thatMonth]`, and leaves every other key untouched — so publishing "next month" (even to clear it) no longer wipes out "this month"'s data. The endpoint rejects any `month` that isn't the real-current or real-next `YYYY-MM` (computed server-side in Malaysia time, UTC+8) and prunes any other key out of `months` on every publish, so the file never holds more than these two months at once. `kuliah/jadual/script.js` looks up `jsonData.months[monthKey]` where `monthKey` is derived from `baseDate` (today, or +1 month for `?bulan=depan`) — so month rollover (July → August) is automatically correct with no republish needed, since the key was already written when that month was "next month". If a month key is entirely absent (never published), the public page shows "Jadual belum diterbitkan buat masa ini." instead of a blank-looking page.

**Local testing:** `Terbitkan` calls `POST /api/publish`, a Vercel serverless function that does not exist under plain `python -m http.server` (the documented local-dev method for this repo) — it will 404 and surface as a "Ralat sambungan" toast. Day-edit/save, and the Duplicate/Clear month actions (below), all write directly to Supabase instead — same production project everywhere, no local/prod split — so they work locally but have real, immediate, non-sandboxed effects on production data.

**Month action buttons only show for the real current/next month:** `dashboard.js`'s `updateScheduleActions()` computes `isRealCurrent`/`isRealNext` from an actual `new Date()` (never from the dashboard's own navigable `currentYear`/`currentMonth`), since `kuliah/jadual/script.js` can only render the real current month or real next month (`?bulan=depan`) — no arbitrary-month param exists. This one computation also drives the "Bulan Ini"/"Bulan Depan" `#month-tag` badge and whether `#future-month-note` (vs the Terbitkan button) is shown.

**Duplicate/Clear month actions:** "Salin Data {previous month}" copies `subuh_ustaz_id`/`maghrib_ustaz_id` only (never `cuti_umum` — holidays are date-specific and copying them forward would mislabel the wrong day) from the month immediately before whatever's currently displayed, matched by day-of-month number, full overwrite (confirmation modal shows how many already-filled target days will be replaced). "Kosongkan Bulan Ini" hard-deletes all `schedule` rows in the viewed month's date range. Both require the confirmation modal — same safeguard regardless of which month is targeted, including the real current/live month.

**Activity log (`activity_log` table + `logActivity()` in app.js, viewed at `userlog.html`, super_admin only):** every mutating admin action inserts one row right after its write succeeds — schedule day edits, bulk duplicate/clear (one summary row each, not per-date), ustaz create/update/delete, admin-account create/update/delete, and Terbitkan/publish (logged server-side from `api/publish.js` using its existing service-role client, since that write happens outside the browser). `target_label`/`detail` are always plain-text snapshots (an ustaz's `short_name`, an admin's email, a month label) — **never** a live foreign key — so history stays readable even after the referenced ustaz/admin is later renamed or deleted. Each call-site captures its "before" value from an already-loaded in-memory cache (`scheduleMap`, `allUstaz`, `allUsers`) rather than an extra query, builds a diff string via a small pure `build*DiffText()` helper local to that page's JS file, and skips the insert entirely if nothing actually changed (no no-op log rows). `logActivity()` never throws or toasts — a logging failure must never make an admin think their actual save/delete/publish failed.

## Print/PDF Export (kuliah/jadual/)

`kuliah/jadual/jadual.html` supports the same `?file=pdf` auto-print export as `kuliah3/jadual/` (see `kuliah3/jadual/CLAUDE.md` for the full write-up and the annotated `@media print` block — read it before touching `kuliah/jadual/style.css`'s print rules).

**Bug fixed 2026-07-06:** exporting PDF from a narrow/mobile-width browser broke the layout (stacked header, missing footer legend) because `kuliah/jadual/style.css`'s `@media (max-width: 768px)` block (line ~459) wasn't scoped to `screen` — the mobile column layout stayed active during printing since `max-width` still matched the exporting device's width, and `@media print` never reset it. **Fixed by changing it to `@media screen and (max-width: 768px)`.** Any new mobile breakpoint block added to this file must use the same `screen`-scoped form, or print output can silently break again.

## Mobile "today card" — any day in the month, not just today/tomorrow (kuliah/jadual/)

The mobile view's day-select dropdown (`script.js`'s `renderTodayCard()`) lets the visitor pick any day within the currently-viewed month, not just today/tomorrow. `buildDaySelectOptions()` lists every day of the month with "Hari Ini"/"Hari Esok" always pinned first using their *real* dates (handles today being the last day of the month, where "tomorrow" spills into next month).

**Poster rendering is uniform across all days:** `buildPosterHtml()` always renders `<img src="{session.poster_url}">` directly from `kuliah`'s own `senaraiHari` data, for today/tomorrow and every other day alike. (Earlier this embedded a digital-signage `<iframe>` for today/tomorrow only — `kuliah/paparan/{today|tomorrow}_{subuh|maghrib}.html`, a separate subsystem on the old non-beta Google-Sheets pipeline — but that was standardized away in favor of the same direct-image approach used for every other day. `.poster-iframe` CSS was removed as dead code along with it.)

## Sensitive Files

- `kuliah/admin/` has no config files with secrets — credentials are Vercel env vars
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — server-side only, never in browser code
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` — Vercel env var only, used in `api/publish.js`
- Supabase anon key in `app.js` is public (safe — RLS enforces access control)
